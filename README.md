### How to host a seminar
- Simply open an issue in this repository with title
  - Format: [YYYY-MM-DD] AWESOME-SEMINAR (e.g. [2010-05-20] [how to train your dragon](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0892769/))
- Ground rules
  - Anyone can present any topic 
  - Don't have to prepare extra material like PPT
  - Don't have to present about a published paper or an official material (e.g. you can present something like your know-how)
- Some recommendations
  - If there are any references or materials (e.g. your own PPT, blog article, or paper link), please list up them in the body of issue before the seminar
  - Please use `labels` in github as tags, so we can categorize our materials (and if there is no related label, [please make one](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29218900/how-to-create-custom-labels-for-issues-on-github))
  - Please open an issue at least a day before the seminar and close the issue after it is presented (if you forget, simply open-and-close an issue after the seminar)
  - After seminar, it would be perfect if we can share our discussion during the seminar as comments
